This is the QFCL random library.

About
=====

Currently, the main contribution of this library is a version of the Mersenne 
Twister (MT19937, MT19937-64 and some older variants) pseudo-random number 
generator, with a discard function that is amortized O(1) with respect to the
jump size (i.e. how many random numbers are discarded). This is an 
improvement over the C++ standard as well as the boost::random library 
version of the Mersenne Twister PRNG which have O(n) discard. 

The ability to discard, i.e. skip ahead, by large jumps is very important for
applications that require parallel pseudo-random number generation, such as
parallelized Monte Carlo simulations for example. For a given seed, suppose 
that a given PRNG generates the sequence x(0), x(1), x(2), ... . The most 
basic method of using this sequence to generate multiple, say N, streams of 
pseudo-random numbers simultaneously is to use the N sequences:
x(0), x(1), x(2), ...
x(p), x(p + 1), x(p + 2), ...
x(2p), x(2p + 1), x(2p + 2), ...
...
x((N-1)p), x((N-1)p + 1), x((N-1)p + 2), ...
The idea is to choose p large enough to ensure that the streams do not 
overlap, as this would artificially introduce inter-stream correlations. In 
the example of parallel Monte Carlo simulation, p must be larger than the 
total number of pseudo-random numbers consumed by all of the simulations of 
any one stream. 

A standard C++ PRNG with O(n) discard must perform (N-1)p single number 
discards in order to set up the above N streams; p discards must be done to 
the original engine, whose next output is x(0), in order to obtain an engine 
whose next number is x(p), then another p discards must be done to get from
x(p) to x(2p), and so on. See the Numerical Example below for the example of
boost's Mersenne Twister. Since p will often need to be a huge number, this
may be infeasible. 

On the other hand, QFCL's Mersenne Twister has amortized O(1) discard. The
"amortized" refers to the need to compute a "jump matrix" for each jump size
p that we wish to use. Given the jump matrix for some p, it costs the same to
discard regardless of the size of p. This jump matrix is also saved to disk 
so that it does not need to be recomputed in the future; moreover, the jump 
matrix remains in memory so that further discards of size p by the current
process can be performed without reading from disk. Note that the computation 
of the jump matrix is O(log p). In the above example, one we have the jump 
matrix, the set up can be done with N-1 jump operations and the cost does not 
depend on p.

Numerical Example
-----------------

Suppose that we want to perform a MC simulation on a computer that is capable
of processing 8 threads simultaneously (e.g. an 8-core processor). The MC 
requires 10,000 simulations, and each simulation can consume up to 
100,000,000 random numbers. Then we can divide the 10,000 simulations into 8 
streams of 1250 simulations, and use a jump size of p = 1250 * 100,000,000 
= 1.25E11. In order to setup the simulation, we need 8 PRNGs, the first 
generating the sequence x(0), x(1), ..., the second generating x(p), x(p + 1) 
and so on.

For a standard C++ PRNG such as boost::random::mt19937 (boost's Mersenne 
Twister), discarding p random numbers requires advancing the state of the
generator p times. This is almost as costly as generating p random numbers 
(it is actually C times as costly for a constant C < 1, since advancing to 
the next state is a bit less work than generating the next number, but C is 
not much smaller than 1). This means that to setup the MC simulation we need
to advance the state p times to get the second generator, then advance 
another p times for the third generator and so on. In total the setup cost is 
similar to generating 7p random numbers, nearly one trillion! Moreover,
clearly the process must be done sequentially and cannot be parallelized.

For QFCL's Mersenne Twister, if the jump matrix for p has not already been
computed, then O(log p) work must be done first. After that it takes only 7
steps to set up the parallel MC.  Moreover, the setup of the MC simulation
can be parallelized for further savings. For example, there is nothing 
preventing the 7 steps from being done simultaneously.

In our example code (see below) a Monte Carlo simulation is set up with the
above parameters. On the author's system, the first run took 6190.3 seconds
(1h43m10.3s) to set up the MC using boost's MT19937, versus 3714.2 seconds
(1h01m54.2s) using the QFCL MT19337. On the second run (using a different
seed to emphasize that the jump matrix depends only on p), the it took 6381.4 
seconds (1h46m21.4s) to set up using boost's MT19937, versus 2.3 seconds 
using the QFCL MT19937 with the jump matrix already computed. We note that 
the MT19937 is a precise (deterministic!) specification for pseudo-random 
number generation, and thus the actual simulation will produce identical 
results for both generators. 

Example Code
============

See examples/README.txt for description of the example code. It demonstrates
the usage of discard and related functionality. The included 
examples/parallel_PRNG_example project implements the above numerical 
example.

QFCL also includes performance tests. Of particular interest is the 
EngineSpeed test which compares the speed of raw random number generation for
various PRNGs. See test/README.txt.

Correctness
===========

QFCL includes a thorough unit test suite, which fully covers the 
functionality of all the included PRNGs. The unit tests are automatically run
at build time.

Build
=====

QFCL uses the CMake build system (www.cmake.org). The main CMakeLists.txt
file is in this directory: qfcl_0_4/CMakeLists.txt.

The only required external library is boost. The build also depends on NTL
(Number Theory Library) and some boost extensions. Our CMake-d version of NTL
is in the directory WinNTL-5_5_2-CMake (this can be used on all platforms).
It is recommended to use this source for NTL, and it must be built before
attempting to build QFCL. QFCL also depends on some boost extensions such as
prf_boost (D. E. Shaw Research) and boost::tti (from boost/trunk). These are
included in the directory boost_extensions, and do not require building since
they are headers only. If you have already supplemented your boost 
installation, you can simply set BOOST_EXTENSIONS_ROOT to the root of your 
boost installation in the CMake-GUI.

In order to build the documentation, doxygen must be installed as well as a 
LaTeX installation that is usable by doxygen.
